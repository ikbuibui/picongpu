    /** Manually driven host event loop combined with a scope owning asynchronous work.
     *
     * This convenience policy has the following semantics:
     * - onControl() returns a lazy sender transferring completion to this loop;
     * - spawn() starts and owns a sender, transfers terminal completion to this
     *   loop, and returns an eager Event;
     * - spawnFuture() does the same while retaining one result value;
     * - runReady() executes a snapshot of queued control work without waiting;
     * - wait() pumps control work until its Event completes, then reports the
     *   ready, failed, or stopped outcome; and
     * - destruction closes and joins the scope while pumping the loop, then
     *   finishes the loop, so destruction may block.
     *
     * No worker thread is created. Control work runs on whichever thread calls
     * wait() or runReady(); "control" expresses intended ownership, not an
     * enforced thread identity. Attach application continuations after
     * onControl(): wrapping an existing chain in spawn() transfers only that
     * chain's terminal completion.
     *
     * This is one policy, not a required Caravan architecture. Applications can
     * instead drive a RunLoop on a dedicated thread, integrate scheduling with
     * an existing GUI/event loop, or pair RunLoop and AsyncScope with explicit
     * shutdown rather than blocking destruction.
